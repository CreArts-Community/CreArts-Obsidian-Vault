# CreArts-Obsidian 

Welcome to CreArts-Obsidian, a customized version of the Minimal Theme for Obsidian. Created by kepano, the Minimal Theme serves as the foundation for this project, but with various modifications and enhancements tailored specifically for CreArts-Obsidian.

Drawing inspiration from the Minimal Theme, CreArts-Obsidian embraces a rounded and flat design, combining modern aesthetics with the delightful catppuccino color scheme. This customized theme offers a visually appealing and intuitive interface for your Obsidian vault.

By leveraging the power of the Minimal Theme as its base, CreArts-Obsidian provides an enhanced user experience with a focus on creativity and productivity. The project includes a preconfigured Vault template, allowing you to effortlessly set up your Obsidian workspace with the CreArts-Obsidian theme.
